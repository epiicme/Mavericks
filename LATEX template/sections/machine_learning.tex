\section{TensorFlow}
TensorFlow provides multiple Aplication Programming Interfaces (APIs) for machine learning. The lowest level API "TensorFlow Core" provides complete programming control.\todo{remember to cite here $https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started$} For those who require fine levels of control over their models, TensorFlow Core is well-suited tool for the job. There are higher level APIs that are built on top of TensorFlow Core. These higher level APIs are typically easier to learn and use than Tensorflow Core \todo{remember to cite here same link as above} In addition, the higher level APIs such as "tf.estimator" helps with managing data sets, estimators, training and infereces (testing your trained network), as well as, making repetitive tasks easier and more consistent.\todo{remember to cite here same link as above}\\

The subsection below, will start with TensorFlow Core. In order to gain understanding on the basic principles that TensorFlow has to offer, a model shall be made. In the subsection after that, the same model will be implemented with tf.estimator. Knowing TensorFlow Core priciples will give us a great mental model of how things are working internally when we use the more compact higher level API.

\subsection{Tensors}
The central unit of data in TensorFlow is the tensor. A tensor consists of a set of primitive values shaped into an array of any number of dimensions. A tensor's rank is its number of dimensions. Here are some examples of tensors:

\begin{lstlisting}
3 # a rank 0 tensor; this is a scalar with shape []
[1., 2., 3.] # a rank 1 tensor; this is a vector with shape [3]
[[1., 2., 3.], [4., 5., 6.]] # a rank 2 tensor; a matrix with shape [2, 3]
[[[1., 2., 3.]], [[7., 8., 9.]]] # a rank 3 tensor with shape [2, 1, 3]
\end{lstlisting}
