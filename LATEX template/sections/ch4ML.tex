\section{Speech Recognition with Deep Learning}

Speech recognition is invading our lives. It’s built into our phones, our game consoles and our smart watches. It’s even automating our homes. For just \$50, you can get an Amazon Echo Dot a magic box that allows you to order pizza, get a weather report or even buy trash bags just by speaking out loud.\\

The Echo Dot has been so popular this holiday season that Amazon can’t seem to keep them in stock!
But speech recognition has been around for decades, so why is it just now hitting the mainstream? The reason is that deep learning finally made speech recognition accurate enough to be useful outside of carefully controlled environments.
Andrew Ng has long predicted that as speech recognition goes from 95\% accurate to 99\% accurate, it will become a primary way that we interact with computers. The idea is that this 4\% accuracy gap is the difference between annoyingly unreliable and incredibly useful. Thanks to Deep Learning, we’re finally cresting that peak.
Let’s learn how to do speech recognition with deep learning!\\
