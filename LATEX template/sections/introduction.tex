The focus of this project will be on implementing speech recognition system...

The main focus is to design and implement an different artifitial neural networks (ANN) and try different regulation techniques to get the best performing speech recognition system we can achieve...

The particular software platform is the open source TensorFlow \cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper} software library released by Google, where it allows non-AI (Artificial Intellegent) experts to design, build, and train deep learning models. In order to create a control solution for the said speech recognizer it is necessary to create a artifitial neural network...\\

Speech is probably the most important forms of communication. Because its the most natural and efficient way to communicate with each other. Humans learn all the relevant skills during early childhood, without any instruction, and they continue to rely on speech communication throughout their life \cite{kamblespeech}. Humans also want to have a similar natural, easy and efficient form of communication with machines. Until recently, the idea of holding a conversation with a computer seemed pure science fiction.

But things are changing, and quickly. A growing number of people now talk to their mobile smart phones, asking them to set reminders, search for directions, or send email and text messages. Chief technology officer of © Nuance Communications Vlad Sejnoha stated, “We’re at a transition point where voice and natural-language understanding are suddenly at the forefront”.
