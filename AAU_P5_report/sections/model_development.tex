\chapter{Model Development}\label{ch:model_development}

In this chapter several models are developed based on the simple LSTM model from the silicon-valley-data-science RNN tutorial \cite{rubashkin2017}. Firstly these models will be trained and tested on a small data set with the numbers:\\ 

$\left\{zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine \right\}$,\\\\
the same data used in Chapter \ref{ch:machine_learning} for the parameter comparison. If all the developed models achieve reasonably results, then they will be trained and tested on a bigger data set (6GB) of english speech. After that, the best performing model shall be chosen for a more detailed discription (with code).
