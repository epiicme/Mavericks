\section{Problem Description}

As mentioned above, the final goal for this project is to develope a distributed
speech recognition(DSR) system.
In order to achieve this goal we need to gain a fundamental understanding in the field of machine learning and networks.

%---------------------------------------------------------
\section{Tools}
The following information is a selection of the relevant hardware, software tools used to implement the GPU accelerated training:

\subsubsection{Software Tools}
\begin{itemize}
	\item TensorFlow 1.3.0
	\item Visual Studio 2015
	\item cuDNN 8.0
	\item Python 3.6
	\item Linux ubuntu
	\item MATLAB  R2017b
	\item C (TCP)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hardware Tools}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Computer
	\item Nvidia Geforce GTX 1070 
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem Delimitation}
To ensure that the project meets the desired scope,
specific success criteria are formed which will be
evaluated during the final stages of the report.
The following list of requirements are the desired
success criteria, where the focus will be on reaching
the given goals.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Data mining
	\item Choose a filter
	\item Design a deep neural network model
	\item Create a Client/Server frame-work
	%\item Create command prompt layout
	\item Implement and test the model on frame-work
\end{itemize}

The best way to increase the performance of our project is to find and used as large of data sets as possible. As open-source, compatible, training sets are hard to come by we will create a data mining algorithm
that will allow us to convert data sets to fit the needs of our project.

Any real life sequence of recorded speech has some amount of noise in 
it. This makes it harder for the network to understand the words that
were spoken and can lead to error that alter the word beyond 
recognition. To ameliorate this problem, a filter that mimics the human
ear is the best fit for such a project.

Along the report, a historical analysis of different knowledge
based solutions to the recognition of human speech is made.  By studying
the existing literature and comparing open-source projects, a neural 
network can be built, with the scope of reducing the error rate as much
as possible.
