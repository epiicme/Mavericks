\section{Problem Description}

As mentioned above, the final goal for this project is to develope a distributed
speech recognition(DSR) system.
In order to achieve this goal we need to gain a fundamental understanding in the field of machine learning and networks.

\section{Problem Delimitation}
To ensure that the project meets the desired scope,
specific success criteria are formed which will be
evaluated during the final stages of the report.
The following list of requirements are the desired
success criteria, where the focus will be on reaching
the given goals.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Data mining
	\item Choose a filter
	\item Design a deep neural network model
	\item Create a Client/Server frame-work
	%\item Create command prompt layout
	\item Implement and test the model on frame-work
\end{itemize}

Brief summary on how are we going to obtain all of these bullet points.
