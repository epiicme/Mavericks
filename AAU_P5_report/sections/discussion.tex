\chapter{Discussion}\label{ch:discussion}

In chapter two, specific success criteria were created to limit the scope and also allow to the project to be evaluated. This discussion will focus on what was accomplished in terms of success criteria and on the possible future steps to improve or advance this project. The list of success criteria from Section \ref{sec:PD}, Problem Delimitation is shown below:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Data mining
	\item Choose a filter
	\item Design a deep neural network model
	\item Train for the English language
	\item Create a Client/Server framework
	\item Implement the distributed model
\end{itemize} 

In order to use the OpenSLR training set, it was crucial to develop and use the scripts detailed in Section \ref{sec:DataMining}
The first algorithm is designed to navigate a folder path and its sub-folders to convert all \textbf{.flac} files to \textbf{.wav}. It uses the os and pydub libraries.
