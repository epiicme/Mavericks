}{% the abstract
  This report goes into detail on the
  implementation of a distributed speech
  recognition system using artificial neural networks.\\
  A historical overview is presented on
  the different methods used in machine learning. 
  Furthermore, neural network fundamentals
  for achieving a practical
  model for speech recognition are explained.
  Various pre-processing algorithms were developed, 
  one of which being a .flac to .wav file converter
  used to create larger data sets for training.
  The Mel Frequency Cepstrum was used as a
  filter and pre-processing technique.
  All of the above mentioned steps were used to pursue a neural network with a 
  bi-directional LSTM layer and fully connected layers. 
  Following, a client-server framework was developed to distribute the obtained model.
  The report encapsulates the entire process 
  for achieving a fully operational system.
