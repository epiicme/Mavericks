}{% the abstract
  This report goes into detail about the
  implementation of a distributed speech
  recognition system using artificial neural networks.
  A historical overview is presented on
  the different methods used in machine learning,
  and explanations of the fundamental principles
  of neural networks for achieving a practical
  model for speech recognition.
  It encapsulates the entire process that is
  required to achieve a fully operational system.
  A .flac to .wav file conversion algorithm
  was developed and used to create newer and
  larger data sets used for training.
  The Mel Frequency Cepstrum was used as a
  filter and pre-processing technique.
  All of the mentioned steps above were used
  to pursue a neural network with a 
  Bi-Directional LSTM layer and Fully Connected 
  layers. After which, a Client/Server model was
  developed to make our model a distributed system.
