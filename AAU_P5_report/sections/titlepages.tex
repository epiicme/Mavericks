}{% the abstract
  This report goes into detail about the implementation         
  of distributed speech recognition systems, information  
  retrieval and machine learning. A historical overview
  is presented to display the different methods
  for achieving a practical model for speech recognition. The main part
  of the project was based around machine learning and neural
  networks so the report includes explanations of the fundamental principles
  used.It encapsulates the entire process that was required to achieve a fully
  operational system. A .flac to .wav file conversion algorithm was developed
   and used to create newer and larger data sets used for training. The
   Mel Frequency Cepstrum was used as a filter and pre-processing technique. All
   of the above mentioned steps were used to pursue a bidirectional, deep 
   recurrent network which uses complex LSTM layers.
