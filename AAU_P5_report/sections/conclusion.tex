\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}


Based on the finding described in the previous chapter, the success criteria that we set were fully realized during the project period. In order to create the distributed speech recognition system, extensive research was done in the field of neural networks, in order to create new neural networks that can provide adequate results. Based on the testing overtaken for all models detailed in this paper, the most efficient model is a fully functional network which acts as an improvement in all aspects compared to the starting point of the research done by us. 
\\

The results show how a neural network approach to the problem of speech recognition problem results in concrete results and increased performances. This bring the idea of a building a non-intrusive way of interacting with computers one step closer to  being considered a standard in every day life.
