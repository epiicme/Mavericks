The project entitled Distributed Speech Recognition System was made by three students from the Electronics and Computer Engineering programme at Aalborg University Esbjerg, for the P5 project during the fifth semester. All of the software written for this project will be referenced on the GitHub project repository.\\\\
We would like to thank our supervisors, Daniel Ortiz-Arroyo and Akbar Hussain, for the
excellent supervision and the help they provided in the initial phases of choosing a 
project.\\\\
We would like to also thank our semester coordinator, Simon Pederson, and Daniel Ortiz-Arroyo for bestowing uppon us
the necessary hardware that was used to achieve our goals, without which this project
couldn`t have been made.
